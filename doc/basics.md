### Parsing

A `Json` value may be obtained from any readable value by passing it to the `Json.parse` method. This could be a
string value, for example,
```scala
import jacinta.*
Json.parse(t"""{ "name": "Alfred", "age": 83 }""")
```
but could also be a file or any other data stream with an appropirate `Readable` typeclass instance in scope:
```scala
import galilei.*
val input = (dir / t"source.json").file
Json.parse(input)
```

If parsing fails, a `JsonParseError` is thrown. Otherwise, an instance of `Json` representing a JSON abstract
syntax tree is returned.

### Serialization

Many types may be serialized to JSON, i.e. converted into instances of `Json`, by calling the `.json` extension
method upon them. `42.json` will produce a `Json` value of the integer `42` represented as a JSON number type.

Other primitive types may be converted in obvious ways, for example, `t"Hello World".json`. Case class instances
may be converted into `Json` instances of objects provided the type of every parameter of the case class can be.
This applies recursively, so a case class composed of other case classes may be serialized to JSON. For example:
```scala
case class Person(firstName: Text, lastName: Text)
case class Recipient(person: Person, emailAddress: Text)

val recipient = Recipient(Person(t"Mike", t"Smith"), t"mike@example.com").json
```

Given these definitions, the `recipient` instance would serialize to the JSON,
```json
{
  "person": {
    "firstName": "Mike",
    "lastName": "Smith"
  },
  "emailAddress": "mike@example.com"
}
```

#### Coproducts

Sealed traits of two or more case class subtypes will be serialized to JSON objects, exactly as each of the
subtypes would be, but with an additional field called `_type`, whose value will be set to the unqualified type
name, e.g. `"_type": "Leaf"`.

Although this encoding of coproduct types is non-standard, it is a reasonable default, and can always be
overridden with specific typeclass instances for the sealed trait type.

#### Collections

Furthermore, all traversable standard collection types can be serialized to JSON arrays, provided the elements
of the collection can be.

### Acessing values

Instances of `Json` are dynamically-typed which means that members with arbitrary names may be accessed as if
they were methods. Taking the `recipient` example above, it would be valid to access `recipient.person`, as if
the method `person` existed on the `Json` type. It doesn't, but since `Json` instances inherit from the special
`Dynamic` trait, the code will be transformed into `recipient.selectDynamic("person")` at compiletime, which
will return a new `Json` instance representing the JSON:
```json
{
  "firstName": "Mike",
  "lastName": "Smith"
}
```

It is therefore possible to call `recipient.person.firstName` directly and get a `Json` value representing the
JSON string, `"Mike"`.

As dynamic values with little known statically about them, instances of type `Json` are not particularly useful
_directly_, and should be converted to other types like `Text`, `Int` or `Person` before being used elsewhere in
a program. This is achieved with the `Json#as` method which takes the destination type as a parameter, for
example,
```scala
val addressee: Text = recipient.person.firstName.as[Text]
```
or,
```scala
val person: Person = recipient.person.as[Person]
```

As well as accessing arbitrary fields in a JSON object, elements of an array may be accessed by simply applying
the integer index to a `Json` value representing an array, for example, `json.organisation.users(2).as[User]`.

#### Errors

Since dynamic field access is unchecked at compiletime, it's possible that a JSON object would not contain the
requested field, or a JSON array would not contain the requsted index. This will throw an exception only when
attempting to convert the value to a static type. So the expression, `recipient.user.firstName`, (noting that
`user` is not a valid field of `recipient`) would not produce an error in itself. Only when invoking,
`recipient.user.firstname.as[Text]` would an exception be thrown, of type `JsonAccessError`.

Similarly, if the expression, `recipient.person.firstName.as[Int]` were evaluated, a `JsonAccessError` would be
thrown due to the field, `firstName` being a JSON string and not a JSON number.

All methods which throw exceptions are annotated with `throws` clauses, and if `saferExceptions` is enabled,
these must be handled.

### Typeclasses

While all Java primitive types and `String`s, collection types and case class types can be serialized and
deserialized automatically, it's possible to support other types or to replace existing default implementations
by providing contextual instances of the typeclasses, `Json.Writer` and `Json.Reader`.

For example, assuming the existence of an `Email` type (which simply wraps a `Text` instance), a `Reader` and
`Writer` for `Email` could be provided in `Email`'s companion object, like so:
```scala
case class Email(value: Text)

object Email:
  given Json.Reader[Email] = json => Email(json.as[Text])
  given Json.Writer[Email] = _.value.json
```
Note that `Email` is a case class, so default instances of `Json.Reader[Email]` and `Json.Writer[Email]` would
exist already, but would be replaced by these new definitions. (If `Email` were instead a non-`case` `class`,
these would be chosen unambiguously as the only contextual instances.)

#### Functor and Cofunctor

`Json.Reader`s are functors, and the `Reader#map` method is provided to transform a reader of one type into a
reader of another. Likewise, `Json.Writer`s are cofunctors with `Writer#contramap` methods. Given these
definitions, an alternative way to write the definitions for `Email` by transforming the existing instances for
the `Text` type would be:
```scala
object Email:
  given Json.Reader[Email] = summon[Json.Reader[Text]].map(Email(_))
  given Json.Writer[Email] = summon[Json.Writer[Text]].contramap(_.value)
```
