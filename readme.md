# Euphemism



## Features

TBC


## Getting Started

TBC


## Status

Euphemism is classified as __fledgling__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

## Availability

Euphemism&rsquo;s source is available on GitHub, and may be built with [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) by
cloning the layer `propensive/euphemism`.
```
